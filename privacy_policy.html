<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> [Month Day, Year]</p>

<p><strong>[App Name]</strong> is a personal tool operated by [Your Name/Handle] (“I”, “me”, or “my”). This tool is not offered to the public. I use it solely to automate posting to my own TikTok account.</p>

<h2>What I Collect</h2>
<p>I do not intentionally collect, store, or process any personal data from visitors or users. There are no accounts, sign-ups, analytics, or cookies on this site.</p>

<h2>TikTok Authorization</h2>
<p>When I log in to TikTok through TikTok’s OAuth flow, TikTok may provide an authorization code which I exchange on my own machine for access/refresh tokens. Those tokens are used only to post to <em>my</em> account. I do not store other people’s data, and I do not grant access to others.</p>

<h2>Hosting & Logs</h2>
<p>This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. As with most web hosting, GitHub may automatically collect standard server logs (e.g., IP address, user agent) when pages are requested. I do not access or use these logs to identify anyone.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>I do not sell or share personal data with third parties. TikTok’s services are governed by TikTok’s own terms and policies.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>I do not retain personal data. Any tokens I generate are for my own account and are stored privately on my own devices for the sole purpose of posting.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>I keep tokens and secrets on my local machine or private storage. Do not send me your credentials or tokens; the app is not for public use.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>This site is not directed to children and does not offer any services to the public.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>I may update this policy to reflect minor operational or legal changes. The “Effective date” will indicate the latest version.</p>
